# Flower-Image-Classification
Udacity Facebook Pytorch Scholarship Challenge Final Challenge Project . The checkpoint file can be downloaded here  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Kzzki8jB57pgbh1sKZR8TyWtO2lwJBw6.
The jupyter notebook file can be run in Google Colab, which was what I used.

Fine-tuned things by changing the run time to GPU or TPU if Google Colab is using CPU.
Because Google Colab allows only 12(or so) hours, I scarely could run 30+ epochs so my accuracy rate lied within 80% - 90%.

You will also need to upload the cat_to_name.json file, which acually represents the categories of flowers to their names. The categories correspond to
the folder labelling in the folder here https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/nd188/flower_data.zip.
